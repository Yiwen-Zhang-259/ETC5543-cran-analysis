# Methods

In this project, we extracted R-package names from CRAN and obtained summary daily download logs of R-packages through the web Application Programming Interface (API) maintained by r-hub[@rhub]. We also collected release dates of R-packages through CRAN. In addition, we also tried to scrap the number of commits in Github repositories for R-packages. Then we conducted eight exploratory data analysis studies: 

- we explored the daily downloads of all the packages on CRAN and figured out the number of R-packages occupied by different downloaded groups; 

- we analyzed the daily download trend of R itself and the found out the most popular version of R; 

- we compared the top 15 downloaded R-packages on CRAN, yearly, on 1st April. from 2013 to 2021, to see how user preference change;

- we figured out the relationship between initial release dates and the total download counts over the most recent 6 month period; 

- we compared two closely related packages : `fable` and `forecast`, to see the difference between their MA (moving average) trends; 

- we studied how the number of commits of master (main) branches on Github repositories may influence the total download counts for the most recent 6 month period; 

- we explored the relationship between the number of updates of R-packages and their download counts; 

- we analyzed the name length patterns for both CRAN task view packages and all of the R-packages on CRAN; 

- we explored how the alphabetical order of R-packages would related to the download counts and the statistic features (e.g.variance, median of the download counts).
