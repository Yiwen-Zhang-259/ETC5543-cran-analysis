# Methods

In this project, we extracted R-package names from CRAN and got summary daily download logs of R-packages through web Application Programming Interface (API) maintained by r-hub[@rhub]. And we also collected release dates of R-packages through CRAN. In addition, we also tried to scrap the number of commits in Github repository for R-packages. Then we constructed eight exploratory data analysis sections: 

- we explored the daily download of all the packages on CRAN and figured out the number of R-packages occupied by different downloaded groups; 

- we analyzed the daily download trend of R itself and the found out the most popular version of R; 

- we compared the top 15 downloaded R-packages on CRAN on 1st April. from year 2013 to 2021 to see how the user preference changes;

- we figured out the relationship between initial release date and the total download count for last half a year; 

- we compared two closely related packages `fable` and `forecast` to see the difference between their MA (moving average); 

- we studied how the number of commits of master (main) branch on Github repository may influence the total download count for last half a year; 

- we explored the relationship between the number of updates of R-packages and its download count; 

- we analyzed the name length pattern for both CRAN task view packages and all the R-packages on CRAN; 

- we explored how the alphabetical order of R-packages would related to the download count and its statistic features (variance, median).
