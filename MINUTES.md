# Minutes 

## Tue 9 Mar 2021

This week, Emi and I talked about things as followed:

1. First we go over the shiny app and Emi explains the "ngram" to me.
	
2. Then Emi tells me to change the layout of the shiny app and solve the data loading issue  (not need to load each time) to make it better.
	
3. Emi introduces the points of each direction : shiny, EDAâ€¦
	
4. Then we come to the Github repo, Emi introduces the project introduction in README file, and tell me to study the related literatures to do the summary of what others have done on this topic and figure out what I can do to extend the work.
	
5. Emi tells me to write something every week and push it to the Github repo to be on track.
	
6. Emi introduces the TODO file and the MINUTES file. The former is used to record the to do things each week and the latter is used to record the content of meeting each week, but after discussion, we think use issue to record the to do things is better. And we can post message or I can receive Emi's questions through that.
	
7. Emi teaches me how to generate the online book of this project in Github, and tells me that the output of this project can be one online book, one html or pdf book to be submitted and the shiny app.
	
8. Then, Emi explains the requirements of this ETC5543 course again. 
	
9. Next, Emi tells to define the related terms such as CRAN task view of this project and also introduce the function of this shiny app to make users understood.
	
10. Finally, we decided that every Tuesday is our regular meeting time.


## Tue 9 Mar 2021

This week, Emi and I talked about things as followed:

1. I first shared what I had done on shiny app. The specific things I have done include : 
   (1) I try to improve the layout of the app and try to figure out the way to speed up the data loading process.(but actually the way I used is wrong
   (2) I read all the related literatures and write summaries on this, so I share the interesting I learned from these packages
   
2. Emi told me the method to make the data loading faster by download a part of the whole data into the local computer first then everytime users need to use the data, they don't have to read it from the website every time. I will try to complete this this week.

3. Emi told me that I should make the interactive table more complicated by linking package name to its downlod log plot.

4. Emi told me dig deeper into the three most interesting packages `packageRank`, `adjustedcranlogs` and `pkgsearch` to figure out the specific method (i.e. the specific mathematical method) they used to achieve their goals. Also thinking about how could I do this? Is there some better way? Or could I extend the exist functions?

5. Emi helped me with the gitbook issue to make it possible for me to generate the remote site book on github.

6. Emi also reminded me that remember to commit regularly and do spend enough time on this project.
