# Minutes 

## Tue 9 Mar 2021

### This week, Emi and I talked about things as followed:

	1. First we go over the shiny app and Emi explains the "ngram" to me.
	
	2. Then Emi tells me to change the layout of the shiny app and solve the data loading issue  (not need to load each time) to make it better.
	
	3. Emi introduces the points of each direction : shiny, EDAâ€¦
	
	4. Then we come to the Github repo, Emi introduces the project introduction in README file, and tell me to study the related literatures to do the summary of what others have done on this topic and figure out what I can do to extend the work.
	
	5. Emi tells me to write something every week and push it to the Github repo to be on track.
	
	6. Emi introduces the TODO file and the MINUTES file. The former is used to record the to do things each week and the latter is used to record the content of meeting each week, but after discussion, we think use issue to record the to do things is better. And we can post message or I can receive Emi's questions through that.
	
	7. Emi teaches me how to generate the online book of this project in Github, and tells me that the output of this project can be one online book, one html or pdf book to be submitted and the shiny app.
	
	8. Then, Emi explains the requirements of this ETC5543 course again. 
	
	9. Next, Emi tells to define the related terms such as CRAN task view of this project and also introduce the function of this shiny app to make users understood.
	
	10. Finally, we decided that every Tuesday is our regular meeting time.
