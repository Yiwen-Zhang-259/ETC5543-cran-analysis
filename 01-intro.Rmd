# Introduction {#intro}

[Think more of a captivating way to start the intro. E.g. below. Start BIG PICTURE. Start narrowing as you go in your paragraph. See for example https://paperpile.com/shared/4ZgBDh or the Monash Q-Manual from your courses.]

The world is engulfed with data as we enter an age where organisations and individuals want to unlock the information within data to better understand the world around us. Harnessing data is not possible without the use of computational tools to calculate key statistics and graphics. Many such computational tools are available but we focus on one of the most popular statistical language, R. 

[Have a look at the TIOBE community index to evidence popularity of R. Make sure you add citations.]


In the world we live in, data are produced all the time, and these data contain not only the operation rules of the objective world, but also all aspects of our ordinary people's life. For example, through the analysis of economic data, we can know the law of market operation. Through the analysis of previous purchase data, we can know the preferences of consumers. Maybe even the consumers themselves are not aware of it and are surprised!

However, data is only a carrier, only after processing and calculation, we can dig out the "information" behind the data. Therefore, many computing tools were born, such as C, Java and Python. In this project, we only focus on one of these : R. 

R is an increasing popular statistical language with around top 10 ranking in TIOBE Index[@tiobe]. In the process of using R, we need to extend its functions with the help of R packages, so R packages have become an indispensable part when people use R to work and study. Due to that, both users and developers are concerned about practicality and popularity of R packages from CRAN, a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. 

Based on this, researchers have started to study the popularity of R packages from CRAN. The most intuitive embodiment of popularity is the total number of downloads, although it does not directly reflect the number of users, because it includes the same user's repeated downloads, updates and test downloads caused by the server. But we still assume in this project that after adjustments, the download amount is a reliable and simple measure of packages' popularity. Back to the previous studies, the R-package `adjustedcranlogs` finds that there are spike in downloads due to automatic re-downloads and package update, and it also provides a method to remove these download logs. And package `packageRank` provides a way to compute the rank percentile for packages and filter the invalid downloads including small and medium size logs. What's more, there are also some packages such as `pkgsearch` and `Visualize.CRAN.Downloads` providing some visualization methods to explore the package download trend or for convenient searching. Some of them are function extensions based on previous packages, and some of them  propose their own new functions, but generally speaking, they are inclined to be more tool like to help users explore the characteristics of package download logs from as many dimensions as possible. 

As for us, the purpose of this project is to analyze and explore the packages download on CRAN, and try to provide one or more methods to modify the download amount of packages or help users and developers better understand the download amount pattern. And there are some terms involved in this project.

- R language : R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which can be extended easily via packages and provide an Open Source route to participation in statistical methodology. It is available as Free Software under the term of the Free Software Foundationâ€™s GNU General Public License [@gnu].

- R Studio : It is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

- R Packages : They are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones.

- CRAN : It is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.

- CRAN mirror : It is a website containing differently located servers, which aims to facilitate people from different regions and countries to access CRAN more smoothly and quickly. And each server is called a mirror.

- API : It is the abbreviation of Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. 

- CRAN task view : It aims to provide some guidance which packages on CRAN are relevant for tasks related to a certain topic [@crantaskviews].
