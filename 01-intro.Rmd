# Abstract

Data is closely related to social and economic activities and our daily life, so data mining and analysis will definitely benefit us. In many statistical and data analysis tools, we choose R, and set the research object as the download logs of R package. By obtaining the daily and recent half year total download count of R package and R itself, we analyze their pattern characteristics, as well as the relationship between the release date, update times, number of commits on Github, name length and alphabetic order of the packages. Finally, we also check the changes of the top 15 downloaded packages on 1st April from 2013 to 2021, to have a glance of how the user preferences changes to some extent.

# Introduction {#intro}

Data, which has penetrated into every industry and business field, has become an increasingly important production factor and is closely related to our life.  For example, every day, before getting up, you may pick up your smart phone and check the weather forecast based on comprehensive analysis of various data, so as to decide today's dress and schedule. Another example is, when you are shopping on the website, you may probably find that the products recommended by big data algorithm always coincide with what you exactly want recently. Obviously, the digitalization of information makes our life easier and more convenient.

However, as we know, the data itself is not of great significance, because it is difficult for us to obtain direct and effective information from simple numbers or other kinds of data before processing, that is to say, what really matters is the information hidden behind the data. In other words, data is only a carrier, only after processing and calculation, we can dig out the "information" behind the data. Therefore, many computing tools were born, such as C, Java and Python. In this project, we only focus on one of these : R. 

R is an increasing popular statistical language with around top 10 ranking in TIOBE Index[@tiobe]. In the process of using R, we need to extend its functions with the help of R packages, so R packages have become an indispensable part for R users. Although there are many sources to get installed R packages such as Bioconductor, Gitlab or R-Forge, we only focus on CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network), which is the official R packages repository. And there are quite a lot CRAN mirrors for the convenient for people from different regions, but we only focus on CRAN in Australia. And So far (up to 2021-06-07), there have been 17700 R packages on CRAN.

Based on this, researchers have started to study the popularity of R packages from CRAN. The most intuitive embodiment of popularity is the total number of downloads, although it does not directly reflect the number of users, because it includes the same user's repeated downloads, updates and test downloads caused by the server. But we still assume in this project that, the download amount is a reliable and simple measure of packages' popularity. Back to the previous studies, the R-package `adjustedcranlogs` finds that there are spike in downloads due to automatic re-downloads and package update, and it also provides a method to remove these download logs. And package `packageRank` provides a way to compute the rank percentile for packages and filter the invalid downloads including small and medium size logs. What's more, there are also some packages such as `pkgsearch` and `Visualize.CRAN.Downloads` providing some visualization methods to explore the package download trend or for convenient searching. Some of them are function extensions based on previous packages, and some of them  propose their own new functions, but generally speaking, they are inclined to be more tool like to help users explore the characteristics of package download logs from as many dimensions as possible. 

As for us, the purpose of this project is to explore the download logs of R packages on CRAN and analyze the relationship between some influential factors with it to help users and developers better understand the download amount pattern. And there are some terms involved in this project.

- R language : R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which can be extended easily via packages and provide an Open Source route to participation in statistical methodology. It is available as Free Software under the term of the Free Software Foundationâ€™s GNU General Public License [@gnu].

- R Studio : It is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

- R Packages : They are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones.

- CRAN : It is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.

- CRAN mirror : It is a website containing differently located servers, which aims to facilitate people from different regions and countries to access CRAN more smoothly and quickly. And each server is called a mirror.

- API : It is the abbreviation of Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. 

- CRAN task view : It aims to provide some guidance which packages on CRAN are relevant for tasks related to a certain topic [@crantaskviews].
