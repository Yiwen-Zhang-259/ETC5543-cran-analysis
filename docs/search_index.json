In the process of using R, we need to extend its functions with the help of R packages, so R packages have become an indispensable part when people use R to work and study.Due to that, both users and developers are concerned about the download amount and popularity of R packages that can be downloaded from CRAN, a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. Based on this, researchers have started to study the popularity of R packages from CRAN. For example, a package adjustedcranlogs finds that there are spike in downloads due to automatic re-downloads and package update, and it also provides a method to remove these download logs. And package packageRank provides a way to compute the rank percentile for packages and filter the invalid downloads including small and medium size logs. What’s more, there are also some packages such as pkgsearch and Visualize.CRAN.Downloads providing some visualization methods to explore the package download trend or for convenient searching. As for us, we investigated the historical data of CRAN dowload logs and found that… (to be added) Next, I would like to introduce some terms involved in this project. R language : R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which can be extended easily via packages and provide an Open Source route to participation in statistical methodology. It is available as Free Software under the term of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License(“The GNU Operating System and the Free Software Movement” 1991). R Studio : It is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. R Packages : They are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones. CRAN : It is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. CRAN mirror : It is a website containing differently located servers, which aims to facilitate people from different regions and countries to access CRAN more smoothly and quickly. And each server is called a mirror. API : It is the abbreviation of Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. 1.1 rtrends the purpose of this project is to analyze and explore the packages download on CRAN, and try to provide one or more methods to modify the download amount of packages or help users and developers better understand the download amount pattern. 1.2 Helpful tips You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). "],["analysis.html", "Chapter 2 Analysis 2.1 Daily top 15 downloaded packages 2.2 Compare last two years’ downloads with the release date", " Chapter 2 Analysis 2.1 Daily top 15 downloaded packages 2.2 Compare last two years’ downloads with the release date Packages for Time Series Analysis It can be seen from Figure 2.1 that although package fable is older than forecast, its download count is much less than that of forecast. And we could see that the most downloaded package is zoo published on 2021-03-09, and next is forecast. So we can see that among time series packages, the two packages with the highest downloads have relatively new release dates. At the same time, we also notice that the number of downloads of package slider with the latest release date is not ideal. This may be because it is too new, few people know about it, and people are used to the old package and probably tend not to use the new one. p.s. very interesting point : the most downloaded zoo does not have a github version, while the second downloaded forecast does have one. Figure 2.1: The older package ‘fable’ has less download count than that of package ‘forecast.’ Bayesian packages for general model fitting Let’s have a look at the bayesian packages used for general model fitting. It can be seen from Figure 2.2 that the most downloaded packages are two with relatively late release dates : arm and loo. Then the two packages bayesm and mcmc with the earliest release date were moderately downloaded. At the same time, we can also notice that the package with the smallest downloads named nimble also comes from the relatively recent date. Therefore, in this type of packages, we can say that the later the release date, the higher the download volume of the package. But there are still some special cases. That is even if the release date is later, the download volume is still not ideal, which may be due to other reasons. Figure 2.2: last two years’ downloads with the release date for bayesian general model fitting packages. Econometrics for basic linear regression In order to test whether this is the case in other areas, let’s turn our attention to econometrics packages for basic linear regression. It can be seen from Figure 2.3 that the latest package sandwich has the highest downloads, while the downloads of nonnest2 with the earliest release date is much lower than it. This is very similar to Bayesian’s case, that is, the latest packages tend to have higher downloads, with some special cases, such as the release date of packages whose downloads is highest or lowest may be in the middle position. Figure 2.3: The latest package ’sandwich` has the highest downloads.
