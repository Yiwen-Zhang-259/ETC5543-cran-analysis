[["data-methods.html", "Section 3 Data &amp; Methods", " Section 3 Data &amp; Methods The main source of data used in this report is the download logs from the RStudio CRAN mirror site https://cran.rstudio.com/. In this project, we extracted R package names from CRAN and got summary daily download logs of R packages through web API maintained by r-hub(R-Hub, n.d.). And we also collected release dates of R packages through CRAN. In addition, we also tried to scrap the number of commits in Github repository for R packages. Then we constructed eight exploratory data analysis sections: we explored the daily download of all the packages on CRAN and figured out the number of packages occupied by different downloaded groups; we analyzed the daily download trend of R itself and the found out the most popular version of R; we compared the top 15 downloaded packages on CRAN on 1st April. from year 2013 to 2021 to see how the user preference changes; we figured out the relationship between initial release date and the total download count for last half a year; we compared two closely related packages fable and forecast to see the difference between their MA (moving average); we studied how the number of commits of master (main) branch on Github repository influence the total download count for last half a year; we explored the relationship between the number of updates of packages and its download count; we analyzed the name length pattern for both CRAN task view packages and all the packages on CRAN; we explored how the alphabetical order of packages affected the download count and its statistic features (variance, median).
