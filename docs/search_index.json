[["results.html", "Section 5 Results ", " Section 5 Results "],["daily-downloads-of-r-packages.html", "5.1 Daily downloads of R-packages", " 5.1 Daily downloads of R-packages Finding 1: There was unusual download activities in one day of 2014 and 2018. In this first section, we studied the daily downloads of CRAN R-packages from 2012-10-01 to 2021-06-12. The data was obtained from the cranlogs package(Csárdi 2019), which includes a summary of the download logs via the RStudio CRAN mirror. The daily download data for CRAN R-packages are available from 1st October 2012. Examination of this data showed two unusual observations in 2014 and 2018 as shown in Figure 5.1. The one happening in 2014 was on 2014-11-17, Monday, while the other one happening in 2018 was on 2018-10-21, Sunday. Figure 5.1: Unusual download spikes in 2014 and 2018. When having a closer look into those two spikes, we firstly focused on the one on 2014-11-17. From Table 5.1, we could see that the downloads of top downloaded R-packages on this day differs little, indicating this spike is not due to a certain package. Table 5.1: The total downloads of each R-package on 2014-11-17 package n BayHaz 767035 clhs 660298 GPseq 394840 OPI 382518 YaleToolkit 370513 survsim 224994 BAT 40592 Rcpp 3509 ggplot2 3167 plyr 3150 Table 5.2 shows the downloads from different countries on 2014-11-17. It is obvious that Indonesia obtains much more downloads than any others. Table 5.2: The countries downloading from CRAN on 2014-11-17 country n ID 2863576 US 96336 CN 32729 DE 14548 FR 11860 GB 10491 IN 8635 HK 8090 BE 7720 KR 6794 Furthermore, we also checked IP addresses, displayed in Table 5.3. Downloads from ip3758 is much higher than others. So, it seems that most of the downloads are owing to one certain IP for the unusual spike in 2014. Table 5.3: The IP addresses downloading from CRAN on 2014-11-17 ip_id n 3758 2863432 11536 6244 11725 5992 16385 5991 534 5986 3784 5983 18519 4511 80 2124 27 1892 464 1375 Next, we turned to the unusual spike in 2018. Table 5.4 shows the downloads from tidyverse is much higher than others, with nearly three orders of magnitude. Table 5.4: The total downloads of each R-package on 2018-10-21 package n tidyverse 11692582 Rcpp 16263 stringi 13981 rlang 13796 ggplot2 13306 dplyr 13081 glue 12593 digest 12302 stringr 11505 fansi 11275 As for country, from Table 5.5, we could know that US occupies the most part of downloads on that day. Table 5.5: The countries downloading from CRAN on 2018-10-21 country n US 12140853 NA 179847 GB 76624 IN 51502 CN 46095 TR 36590 AU 35078 DE 32837 CA 31125 KR 30469 Finally, the most interesting finding is on IP address, displayed in Table 5.6. Several consecutive IPs have highly distinguished downloads. It seems that they are probably from the same individual, or caused by a server test issue, in such a short period of time. Table 5.6: The IP addresses downloading from CRAN on 2018-10-21 ip_id n 266 3034720 263 2457383 655 2099321 264 1557640 267 1406876 265 1032535 2 179711 268 99932 112 34397 3296 17223 To sum up, we found that these two unusual spikes have one thing in common, that is, most of the downloads came from a specific country. The difference is that in 2014, a large number of downloads came from several different R-packages, while in 2018, they came from only one package tidyverse. In addition, in 2014, a large quantities of downloads came from one IP, while in 2018, they came from several consecutive IPs, At this point, it is guessed that they should come from the same individual, and it is very likely due to sever test issue, for it may be not necessary or reasonable for an individual to generate such a large amount downloads in one day. Finding 2: There are increasing numbers of downloads over time, which can attests the growing number of R users. Figure 5.2 shows the download trend of all R-packages on CRAN over a period pf time from 2012-10-01 to 2021-06-12, after fixing the unusual spikes mentioned above. There is an upward trend, with an increasing variance in download counts. Figure 5.2: The download trend of all R-packages on CRAN from 2012-10-01 to 2021-06-12. Finding 3: Weekends have a lower downloads than weekdays. To have a closer look at the weekly pattern, figure 5.3 shows the daily downloads of all CRAN R-packages via the RStudio mirror, with the grey areas highlighting the weekend. To be more specific, except for 2012 and 2013, the patterns of other years are very similar, with a strong weekly seasonality. To be more detailed, in 2012, the download logs showed an overall upward trend, which also reflected more and more users there after release of CRAN. In the following years, there is no obvious trend in download volume, but a strong seasonality, which indicates that in a week, the total downloads always increases first then decreases, and reaches the lowest on weekends. Although the pattern of 2013 is more volatile, it still conforms to that. We suppose that is because CRAN was only open for a short period of time in 2013, so the amount of download data is not adequate to show the weekly pattern very clearly. After 2016, the pattern of each year is quite consistent, for the total downloads have been increasing year by year. Back to weekly seasonality, people are more likely to download packages during weekdays, and rest on weekends. So, the trough of download curve always occurs on weekends. In addition, the lowest downloads across the year are always happening at the end of December or the beginning of January, probably due to the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. Meanwhile, the downloads are on the rise from August to October, and from February to April, which covers the beginning of semesters for many universities around the world, a time when related students tend to download CRAN R-packages very often. Figure 5.3: The total downloads for all of R-packages on CRAN would decrease on weekends and increase during weekdays. As there are many fluctuations in daily download pattern, which is due to calendar effect and test server issue of CRAN mirror, an STL decomposition model explained in Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2021a), was applied, to smooth the curve for all of the R-packages in Figure 5.4. Figure 5.4: The total downloads of all R-packages on CRAN after smoothing. Figure 5.5 shows the distributions and the median of the downloads between weekday and weekends, which differ from each other a lot. The violin plots of weekends are wider and shorter, while those of weekdays are thinner and higher, on the contrary. That is because the total downloads on weekends are less than those in weekdays. In 2012, the median and interquartile range of download logs are not very distinguished between weekdays and weekends, for the data volume was not adequate at this time as mentioned before. But after 2013, the gap between the two has been becoming more and more obvious. The median downloads of working days are significantly higher than those of weekends, and the overall download volume is also significantly larger than that of weekends as well. Interestingly, the lower adjacent sometimes occurs on weekends, such as in year 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019 and 2021, while sometimes also in weekdays, such as in year 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2020. Figure 5.5: The violin plot for downloads of all of R-packages on CRAN, between weekday and weekends. Finding 4: Top 10% downloaded R-packages share nearly 90% cumulative download counts of the whole. From the previous analysis, we could see that the cumulative download counts of R-packages show an increasing trend. It would be perfect equality if every R-package had the same download count : the last 20% downloaded R-packages would gain 20% of the total download count or the top 60% downloaded R-packages would get 60% of the total download count. But knowing from experience, we know that is hardly possible. So, here, we introduced Lorenz curve(Pettinger 2021) to show the respective numbers of R-packages within different download levels (groups defined by quantiles of download counts). In this way, we could figure out how many download counts contributed by different downloaded R-packages. Figure 5.6 shows cumulative download counts against each downloaded group. It can be seen that most of the download counts come from the top 10% downloaded R-packages. At the same time, we could also observe that the Gini value is close to 1, which indicates that the download volumes across groups are quite unbalanced. In fact, the download volume of the top 10% group is extremely distinguished from that of the following groups. It’s not hard to understand that this group should contain some R-packages with high popularity and large quantities of users. Figure 5.6: Percentiles of the download counts against cumulative download counts for R-packages at or below that percentile. For example, if we extracted the first 10 packages of this group in Table 5.7, we could find that there are many quite famous and frequently-used R-packages, such as rlang and dplyr. Table 5.7: First 10 R-packages of top 10% downloaded group package total rlang 15572507 vctrs 13544857 dplyr 12739206 ggplot2 12670952 jsonlite 12627542 lifecycle 11124212 tibble 10935860 magrittr 10312021 pillar 9566463 glue 9534999 References "],["daily-downloads-of-r.html", "5.2 Daily downloads of R", " 5.2 Daily downloads of R In this section, we studied the daily downloads of R language itself from 2012-10-01 to 2021-06-12. The data was obtained from the cranlogs package (Csárdi 2019) as well. Finding 1: There is an upward trend in the number of downloads, also with an increasing variance. Figure 5.7 shows the download trend of R on CRAN over the period of time, from 2012-10-01 to 2021-06-12. An upward trend shows, with an increasing variance in download counts, which is resulted from the growth of R users. As for significant spikes, they are probably quite similar to the situation of R-packages, which is due to repeated downloads, weekly calendar effect or server test issue. Figure 5.7: The download trend of R on CRAN, from 2012-10-01 to 2021-06-12. Finding 2: The most used operation system for R users turns out to be Windows OS. Figure 5.8 shows the comparison of operation systems for R users. The number of Windows-user ranks first, followed by MacOS and SRC. Microsoft has traditionally dominated the desktop and laptop market. And Microsoft officially claims there are 400 million active users of Windows 10 itself, while Apple revealed that there are only around 100 million active Mac users, up to now.(Warren 2017) Figure 5.8: The comparison of operation system (OS) for R users, from 2012-10-01 to 2021-06-12. Finding 3: The most popular version of R is 3.2.1 Table 5.8 shows the first 10 numbers of downloads for different versions of R. The most downloaded one is 3.2.1 with 4526 times, followed by 3.3.3 with 4305 times and 3.1.2 with 3958 times. Most users are likely to install the latest version of R to get the newest update information. Table 5.8: The numbers of downloads for different versions of R R_version count 3.2.1 4526 3.3.3 4305 3.1.2 3958 3.2.2 3781 3.4.0 3585 3.1.1 3458 3.5.1 3450 3.4.3 3409 3.4.1 3398 3.3.0 3362 In conclusion, the daily download trends of R are quite similar to those of R-packages, and they are both significantly correlated to weekly calendar as well as unusual downloads from CRAN mirrors. In general, they both tend to increase with the growing of R users. References "],["daily-top-15-downloaded-r-packages.html", "5.3 Daily top 15 downloaded R-packages", " 5.3 Daily top 15 downloaded R-packages In this section, we studied the top 15 downloaded R-packages from 2013-04-01 to 2021-04-01, to see how user preferences have been changing. The data were obtained from CRAN website [http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/packages.rds]. We are supposed to know that some R-packages are hold by Rstudio, some are developed by core personnel or personnel closely related to R, and some are created by prolific developers(“The Most Prolific Package Maintainers on CRAN” 2018). And there are also parts of R-packages that are dependency packages of others, which means the increasing downloads of their “father” packages would also promote the downloads of them. For example, R-package fable is dependency package within R-package fpp3. When users install fpp3, fable would also be installed at the same time. Naturally, the numbers of downloads for those packages can probably be higher. On the one hand, the R-packages developed by those experienced developers may be more mature and completed. On the other hand, users are more inclined to use packages produced by famous authors, which can be regarded as a kind of “good use” guarantee. However, the existence of those packages can cause the results of user preferences biased. Therefore, we decided to explore the R-packages constructed by non-special creators, and screened out four types of R-packages, namely: R-packages maintained by R studio R-packages created by authors from R core group R-packages created by authors from R secondary group R-packages created by R related authors R-packages created by top 20 prolific maintainers (This is resourced at “The Most Prolific Package Maintainers on CRAN” (2018)) After that, we generated a lorenz curve here again in Figure 5.9, it can be observed that the distribution of R-packages in each download group is more equal now and the Gini value decreases as well, for the ‘extreme effect’ brought by highly-downloaded packages has disappeared. Thus, the user preferences could be shown more clearly. However, after filtering, the number of remaining R-packages is only 58, which is a too small-sized sample to conduct representative conclusions, we would still focus on all of R-packages on CRAN in later analysis. Figure 5.9: Percentiles of the download counts against cumulative download counts of R-packages after filtering four types of popular and highly-downloaded packages. Finding 1: The topic of newly added R-packages come from quite different application areas, each year. Table 5.9 shows the R-packages that newly come up to the top 15 list each year, from which we can know how the user preferences have changed year by year, compared with the previous year. To be more specific : For 2014, ncdf ranks first, which is used to provide an interface to netCDF format data. For 2015, the first downloaded R-package is XLConnectJars, related to JAVA dependency. For 2016, the first downloaded R-package is reports, for standardising the output of R. For 2017, lava.tobit aims to help with estimation and simulation of latent variable models. For 2018, the first-ranking ReportsRs is for creating Microsoft Word and Powerpoint documents. For 2019, CALIBERrfimpute is used to impute missing values in analysis datasets using full conditional specifications. For 2020, SparkR is similar to dplyr but for large datasets. For 2021, heatmap.plus is an extension of heatmap() function.

The most popular application filed is on JAVA dependency. Table 5.10 shows the R-packages that remain unchanged each year, compared to the previous year, from which we can know which packages are relatively stable in popularity. To be more specific, packages like XLConnectJars, DMwR, KoNLP, and gWidgets are relatively popular through years from 2014 to 2021. They are used for providing JAVA dependency, data mining, linguistic research and providing API for building toolkit-independent, interactive GUIs.

Trending R-packages are ones downloaded at least 1000 times last week, which have increased significantly compared to the average weekly downloads in the previous 24 weeks(R-Hub, n.d.). That is to say, they are packages with significantly high download volume in a recent short time. Through their topics, we can know what application areas of R-packages that people are concerned about recently. Finding 3: The most popular topic of trending R-packages. Table 5.11 shows the top 10 downloaded topics for trending R-packages. The most popular topic is WebTechnologies, followed by Multivariate and TimeSeries. This is easy to understand : the numbers of users from different fields are different, so the downloads of R-packages in different topics also varies. It seems that WebTechnologies is quite heated recently. Table 5.11: Ranking topics of trending R-packages topic download times WebTechnologies 5 Multivariate 4 TimeSeries 4 Cluster 2 Distributions 2 ExperimentalDesign 2 Phylogenetics 2 SocialSciences 2 Finance 1 gR 1 Apart from the topics of R-packages, what other factors can probably be linked to download volumes? With this question in mind, we then explored the relationship between the total number of download counts for all of CRAN R-packages and the earliest release date in the past year. We also studied the relationship between the total download volume and the number of updates, the number of commits on master (main) branch in GitHub repositories, the lengths and the alphabetical order of names, over the most recent 6 month period, in the following sections. References "],["compare-last-years-downloads-with-the-initial-release-date.html", "5.4 Compare last year’s downloads with the initial release date", " 5.4 Compare last year’s downloads with the initial release date Finding: R-packages that are initially released earlier on CRAN tend to have higher download counts in the past year. That is perhaps because, in earlier times, there were fewer R-packages in the same category, then users had ‘no choice’ but to use them. Due to that, those R-packages would accumulate user base, which makes it more possible to attract new users. In our common cognition, it may be assumed that the earlier an R-package is released, the more people can get to know it, and thus the more downloads it can have. However, R-packages related to different topics cannot be directly compared, because download counts of R-packages in one topic can be higher than that in another. Therefore, in order to test this conjecture as clearly as possible, we selected three domain R-packages through CRAN task view(“CRAN Task Views,” n.d.), calculated their respective downloads in the previous one year, and extracted their earliest release dates for comparison. Those three topics are : R-packages for Time Series Analysis The first topic is Time Series Analysis. Time Series Analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis. Time series data means that data is in a series of particular time periods or intervals(“Time Series Analysis” 2020). Bayesian R-packages for general model fitting The second topic is Bayesian Inference. Bayesian statistics is a mathematical procedure that applies probabilities to statistical problems. It provides people the tools to update their beliefs in the evidence of new data(perpetual 2019). Econometrics R-packages The last topic is related to econometrics. Econometrics is the use of statistical methods using quantitative data to develop theories or test existing hypotheses in economics or finance, which relies on techniques such as regression models and null hypothesis testing(Hayes 2020). Figure 5.10 displays the scatterplot of the past year’s download counts and the earliest release dates, for Time Series Analysis, Econometrics and Bayesian R-packages. It can be seen that, generally, as the earliest release dates get later and later, the numbers of download logs become lower and lower. For Time Series Analysis R-packages, they are mainly released between 2012 and 2019. For Bayesian R-packages, most of the R-packages are born from 2007 to 2012. And most Econometrics are centered between 2013 and 2016. Figure 5.10: The download counts decrease with the initial release dates. In conclusion, it is not surprising to find that the earlier the R-package is released, the more downloads it could have, which is reflected in all of three topics above. That is probably because the R-packages released earlier can be better-known. When they are released early, there may be a relatively small number of R-packages in the same topic, under non-serious competition. As a result, the R-packages coming later can easily be covered up, since people may generally tend to use well-known, mature and habitual packages. That is to say, earlier R-packages are more conducive to the cultivation of user habits. After all, habits are influenced by the length of time. For example, if the teacher is a senior user of an R-package, they may recommend that R-package to their students when teaching, especially when they obtain a satisfying user experience. References "],["compare-moving-average-trends-for-fable-and-forecast.html", "5.5 Compare moving average trends for fable and forecast", " 5.5 Compare moving average trends for fable and forecast Finding: R-package ‘forecast’ has a more stable download trend comparing to ‘fable.’ When ‘fable’ gets updated, its downloads peaked, while ‘forecast’ suffers a dropping, on the contrast. As stated in the previous section, the earlier an R-package is released, the easier it can be to get a relatively higher total downloads. But that doesn’t mean a better growth will exist. Due to that, in this section, we compared package fable and forecast. They are two closely related R-packages, for fable is the later released tidy version of forecast. And in this way, we can approximately fix all of factors, except the initial release date, so that we can compare the growth and changes of those two more clearly. Figure 5.11 and Figure 5.12 show the daily download counts changing over the most recent 6 month period, with strong weekly seasonality. That means the downloads tend to be higher within week days and thus lower on weekends, which is consistent with trend for all of R-packages that was analyzed before. Figure 5.11: The daily downloads of R-package “fable” Figure 5.12: The daily downloads of R-package “forecast.” Therefore, in order to estimate the trend-cycle and reduce the weekly seasonality, to see the changes more clearly, the Moving Average (MA) was introduced(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2021b). A moving average of order m can be written as : \\[T_t = \\frac1m\\ \\Sigma_{j = -k}^{k}y_{t+j} \\] where m=2k+1. That is, the estimate of the trend-cycle at time t is obtained by averaging values of the time series within k periods of t. And here, we considered an equal weighed 7 moving average. It calculates the weighted average for every seven consecutive time series with the following weights : [1/7,1/7,1/7,1/7,1/7,1/7,1/7]. Figure 5.13 shows the moving average (MA) of fable and forecast respectively. They have quite different moving average patterns, when forecast’s download volume is much higher than that of fable, except for the time around New Year’s Eve, with a significant drop in forecast. But during that time, a drop also appears in fable, which was probably due to the big New Year holiday. In addition, the purple vertical dashed line in plot of fable marks the update day of it, on 2021-1-29. Soon after that day, fable’s downloads peaked, which was due to the increase brought by update day. At the same time, forecast drops, then only gets a gentle increase. Figure 5.13: The moving averages of R-package “forecast” and “fable.” In conclusion, the download variance of forecast is larger than that of fable while the former looks relatively more stable than the latter, after applying the moving average. It coincides with the conclusion of the previous section : the earlier released R-package tends to obtain more cumulative downloads. In addition, we can also see that the growths of both of two sometimes increase at the same time, while the growth of one can correspond to the decline of the other, sometimes. As for as we concerned, the shared growth may be due to their similarity. Users may download both at the same to compare, like us. And the trade-off may also be due to their similar functions, one can be replaced by the other. Finally, earlier release does not guarantee a faster growth. For example, fable has a more dramatic growth than forecast from 2021-01-21 to 2021-02-06. References "],["compare-download-counts-with-the-number-of-commits-on-master-branch.html", "5.6 Compare download counts with the number of commits on master branch", " 5.6 Compare download counts with the number of commits on master branch In this section, we compared total downloads over the most recent 6 month period, with the number of commits on master branch in Github repositories. For all of CRAN R-packages, there were only 6185 R-packages that have Github repositories, and after cleaning up, only 5769 remained. Finding: In our initial assumption, more commits on master branch of Github repositories are likely to bring R-packages more download counts. On the one hand, the number of commits can indicate that developers are constantly supplementing and updating their R-packages, which may lead to more downloads. On the other hand, the number of commits also can reflect the attention developers attach to their R-packages, to some extent. Usually, for those who have more commits, their developers may advertise more or try other ways, to expand the popularity and improve the download counts. The way we initially planned to apply was extracting the commits through accessing the Github REST API(“GitHub REST API” 2021). To achieve that, we first scraped the Github URLs from ‘description’ pages for all of R-packages from CRAN, then cleaned up the multiple URLs and other redundant symbols or characters. The URL is formatted as : “https://api.github.com/repos/{user_repo}/commits?per_page=1”. For example, the URL for package tidyverse can be like : “https://api.github.com/repos/tidyverse/tidyverse/commits?per_page=1”. Practically, by replacing the user_repo part that consists of the name of the related repository and the name of the package holder, we could access the contents of URLs through Github API, for all of CRAN R-packages. Based on that, Table 5.12 shows the first 5 R-packages, with their Github URLs and the user_repo parts. However, the Github API has a rate limits, allowing for up to 60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests, which can be extended to 5000 per hour after authentication(“GitHub REST API” 2021). But even after getting authentication, our rate limit didn’t get promoted. So, we switched to scrape commits with Python spider, by setting random user agent, to avoid the API limit. Since this method is quite time consuming (around 5 hours each time for all available R-packages), we saved the output as a local .txt file and load it later in R studio, to speed up the code execution.

In general, more commits can link to more downloads. Figure 5.14: The commits on master branch in Github repositories against the total download counts over the most recent 6 month period. Another method can be conducted by taking the ultra-low-downloaded R-packages into consideration, whose download counts only rank last 1% of all. Another purpose for this way is to show our initial idea on scraping commits through Github API with R (as the sample size is less than 60 R-packages, on this condition). Table 5.14 shows the last 10 quantiles of download counts, it can be seen that the last 1% download count is around 375.16. As the download counts of those packages are extremely low, we could assume that many factors can have little effect on their downloads, and the only two differences among them are the numbers of commits on Github master branch and the total download counts. Based above, we could select those ultra-low-downloaded R-packages and extract commit counts from their Github repositories. In Figure 5.15, it could be observed that when the number of commits increases from 0 to 100, the download counts first increase and then decrease. After that, the download volume keeps rising, with a small jump at the end. We consider that might result from the too small-sized sample, and the observation causing the decline can be an outlier. If expanding the observation horizon, an increase in this curve can be expected. Therefore, it can be concluded that even for those last 1% downloaded R-packages, the phenomenon - “the more commits can link to more downloads” also exists. Table 5.14: Quantile of total download counts for all of R-packages on CRAN download_count 0% 0.00 1% 375.16 2% 721.58 3% 1075.37 4% 1340.32 5% 1562.85 6% 1674.00 7% 1804.53 8% 1903.32 9% 1968.11 Figure 5.15: The commits on master branch of Github repositories, against the total download counts over the most recent 6 month period, for last 1% downloaded R-packages on CRAN. correlation test First, we should verify the test assumption—the distribution of the variables—before selecting an appropriate correlation test. The Shapiro-Wilk test results in Table 5.15 indicate that the p-values for both commits and total are less than 0.05, indicating that their distributions are all non-normal. Additionally, the QQ-plot 5.16 confirms that those variables deviate significantly from the normal distribution. As a result, the Spearman or Kendall correlation test should be used. Table 5.15: Shapiro-Wilk Normal Distribution Test Variable W.value p.value commits on github 0.4312253 3.155336e-82 total downloads 0.1487795 4.933290e-92 Figure 5.16: QQ-plot for the number of commits on master branch in Github and the total downloads. The Kendall rank correlation and Spearman’s correlation for the number of commits on Github’s master(main) branch and total downloads, respectively, can be seen in Tables 5.16 and 5.17. We can see that the p-values are rounding to 0 and 0, which are both less than 0.05, revealing that the relationship between commits and downloads is statistically significant at a 5% confidence level. The estimate coefficients are 0.24 and 0.35, indicating that those two variables have a weak positive correlation. Consequently, we could conclude that the cumulative download count increases between 0.24 and 0.35, as the number of commits on Github’s master(main) branch increases per unit. Table 5.16: Kendall Correlation Test Z.score tau P.value 26.48 0.24 1.50516755781972e-154 Table 5.17: Spearman’s Correlation Test S.score rho P.value 18754296134.1 0.35 2.52355299752742e-161 Figure 5.17 and Figure 5.18 shows the scatterplots, together with correlation estimate coefficients, respectively. Figure 5.17: There is an weak potive relationship between the number of commits on master branch in Github and the cumulative download count, significantly at a 5% confidence level.

References "],["compare-download-counts-with-the-numbers-of-updates.html", "5.7 Compare download counts with the numbers of updates", " 5.7 Compare download counts with the numbers of updates In this section, we looked into the relationship between the numbers of updates and total download counts over the most recent 6 month period, for all of CRAN R-packages. Finding 1: The download counts tend to rise with the numbers of updates. This is probably because there will be a significant increase in downloads when packages get updated. During that time, not only old users often download the latest version, but also it is easier to attract new users, for the increase of downloads within a short period of time can bring packages up to the trending list(R-Hub, n.d.). Figure 5.19 shows that the numbers of downloads increase with the update times. And most R-packages are updated no more than 30 times. Figure 5.19: The download counts increase with the numbers of updates. Finding 2: Over half of the CRAN R-packages are not likely to update very frequently. By checking Table 5.18, we can know that the percentage of R-packages whose updates are less than average is 70.2920266 %, which means much more than half of the CRAN R-packages do not tend to update very frequently. Table 5.18: Percentage of CRAN R-packages whose updates are less than average number of packages with low updates percentage of packages with low updates 11963 70.29203 Finding 3: Most CRAN R-packages keep updating with the time, probably to keep its activity. It can be seen from Figure 5.20 that most R-packages’ latest publish dates are after 2015, which indicates that many R-packages are likely to update with the time, probably in order to keep their activity. Figure 5.20: The latest update dates of CRAN R-packages are almost the recent dates. Finding 4: Most of the CRAN R-packages are likely to update with a relatively long time interval. Figure 5.21 shows that with the increase of update intervals, the numbers of downloads first increase and then decrease slightly. Most of the time intervals are between 45 and 450 days, which shows that their update frequency is not very high. Figure 5.21: Most of the time intervals for updates are between 45 and 450 days. In conclusion, it’s not that the more updates R-packages have, the popular they can be. In actual, most of the CRAN R-packages whose updates are lower than average occupy the majority. Therefore, the numbers of updates are probably not that important for R-packages. The really important thing can be keeping updated along the time. References "],["compare-the-package-name-lengths-with-download-counts.html", "5.8 Compare the package name lengths with download counts", " 5.8 Compare the package name lengths with download counts Here, we still focused on all of R-packages on CRAN, and made comparison between their name lengths and total downloads over the most recent 6 month period. Finding 1: The name lengths of R-packages have no significant correlation with total downloads, over the most recent 6 month period. We could see from Figure 5.22 that, the influence on download volume resulted from name length is not obvious. But we could still observe that the name lengths of most of R-packages are centered before 10 characters long. The names , with more than 6,000,000 downloads, are between 5 and 9 characters long. The most downloaded one is R-package rlang whose name length is 5. Figure 5.22: The names of R-packages with more than 6,000,000 downloads are between 5 and 9 characters long. Finding 2: The average name length of R-packages is about 7.8 characters long, and over half of the R-packages tend to have shorter names, which may make it more easier to be remembered by users. Table 5.19 shows that the average name length of all the R-packages is 7.8472034. And over half of the CRAN R-packages are more likely with name lengths below average. And R-packages with shorter names can be easier to get relatively higher downloads. That may because shorter named packages are easier for users to remember. Table 5.19: Percentage of packages whose name lengths are below average number of short names percentage of short names total average name length 9289 52.58718 7.847203 After finding that there is no obvious relationship between the name lengths and the download volume, a new question came up : Can the name lengths of the R-packages be linked to the time of initial release date? Finding 4: For task view R-packages, the name lengths increase with the initial release dates, especially for Bayesian packages. We may have this kind of experience in life : for example, detective novels, the later they are released, the less names can be chosen, because many names have been occupied by the books published earlier, with the same theme. Therefore, those later published books often have to lengthen their names to distinguish themselves from the existing books. Coincidentally, we guessed the naming of R-packages from the same topic would also be correlated to the initial release time. So, we looked back to the CRAN task view R-packages(“CRAN Task Views,” n.d.), for conducting comparison among R-packages from the same topic. Figure 5.23 shows the name lengths of CRAN task view R-packages against the initial release dates. It is obvious that the name lengths of task view R-package tend to increase with the initial release dates, especially for Bayesian R-packages. Figure 5.23: The name lengths of task view R-packages slightly increase with the initial release dates. Finding 5: For all of R-packages on CRAN, the average name length tends to generally increase with the initial release date. Although we’d better explore this question among R-packages within the same topic, we also had a view on the annual change in the average name length, for all of R-packages on CRAN. Figure 5.24 shows the average name length for all of R-packages on CRAN, released in each year. It is obvious that the name lengths of those R-packages generally increase year by year. Figure 5.24: The average name length for all of R-packages on CRAN released in each year, tends to rise along the time. References "],["compare-download-counts-with-alphabetical-order-of-names.html", "5.9 Compare download counts with alphabetical order of names", " 5.9 Compare download counts with alphabetical order of names We might also have such experiences in our life : when we go shopping in the supermarket, the products placed in front of the shelves can be noticed by us easier. From the perspective of R-packages, in addition to the lengths of names, we also wondered whether alphabetical order can link to the download volume. R-packages with earlier alphabetical order will be placed at the first part of package list on CRAN(“Available CRAN Packages by Name” 2021). To answer this question, we grouped the R-packages by 26-letter order, calculated the average downloads for each group, and made comparisons. Finding 1: For all of CRAN R-packages, the average downloads of different alphabetical groups are slightly increasing with alphabetical order, while the total downloads tend to decrease a little, on the contrary. From Figure 5.25, we could see that the average downloads of different alphabetical groups are slightly increasing with alphabetical order, while the total downloads tend to decrease, instead. That is because the later-ordered groups contain fewer R-packages. Developers may prefer to name their packages with top alphabetical order, which might be easier for users to notice. Figure 5.25: The average total download counts of each group is little linked to the alphabetical order of name, for all of R-packages. Finding 2: For all of R-packages on CRAN, alphabetical groups with higher total downloads tend to have greater variance, owing to more outliers. Then, we took a look at how the variance varies across groups. Figure 5.26 shows the data range and the median value for each alphabetical group. It can be seen that the group “R/r” has the highest outlier and the group “X/x” has the largest variation. The variances across groups difference little, which means that for each group, 50% of the download counts are relatively concentrated. The real difference is the highest and lowest downloads per group. In general, the larger the total numbers of downloads (which also means more packages in this group), the more outliers can be included, such as group “F/f,” “L/l” and “R/r.” Figure 5.26: The R-packages with name starting with “j” has the largest variation. In order to further verify our conclusion, we turned to the ultra-low-downloaded R-packages. As mentioned previously, when it comes to the ultra-low-downloaded R-packages, we could approximately assume the only factor that may affect the downloads is name order here. From Figure 5.27, we could see that the difference in median download counts of each alphabetical group is not significant as we expected. Figure 5.27: The last 1% downloaded R-packages with name starting with “U/u” has only one observation. Therefore, we could approximately draw a conclusion : In general, the R-packages with top alphabetical order can be easier to get relatively higher download volume, with non-significant gaps. At the same time, the higher the numbers of downloads, the greater the variance can appear in this group. References "]]
