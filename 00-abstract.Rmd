# Abstract

This research seeks to analyze the popularity of R-packages and figure out the influential factors. Data are closely related to social and economic activities in our daily life, so data mining and analysis will definitely benefit us. In many statistical and data analysis tools, this research focuses on R in this project, and aim to explore the popularity of R-packages from CRAN. To achieve this, it is assumed in this research that the download volume is a relatively reliable and simple measurement for the popularity of R-packages, and two main parts of analysis has been carried out, one is to uncover the information behind the download count logs, the other is to explore the factors that will affect the download volume. The techniques applied in this research is mainly R, together with a small part of Python on data scraping. By obtaining the daily and recent half a year's total download count of `r comma(length(pkgs$package),digits =0)` R-packages and R itself, this research analyzes their pattern characteristics, as well as the relationship between the release date, update times, number of commits on Github, name length and alphabetic order of the name. Finally, this research also gives the changes of R-user preferences on 1st April from 2013 to 2021, to some extent. 

Moreover, results show that the daily download of R-packages has a strong weekly seasonality and unusual spikes caused by repeat download, update or server issue. The most stably popular R-packages during 2017 to 2019 is about JAVA dependency. And an earlier release date is more likely to bring a higher download volume for R-packages. That is similar to update times and commits number on Github repository. However, the alphabetical order of package name contributes little to the download counts. And over half of the packages on CRAN tend to have shorter names.



KEY WORDS : R package popularity, CRAN download count, Web scraping, Github API, EDA
